# Q-Projects

This repository is for my **risk-neutral quantitative projects**, focused on exploring theoretical frameworks and mathematical models in finance under risk-neutral assumptions. These techniques are widely used in the valuation of derivatives, hedging strategies, and market risk assessment. As I learn and grow, I'll continue adding more projects to deepen my understanding of quantitative finance and its applications.

## ðŸ“˜ Current Project

### Barrier Option Pricing
- Using Monte Carlo simulations to price barrier options under the Heston model.
- Exploring how changes in model parameters affect option prices.

## ðŸ›  Tools I'm Using
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Techniques**:
  - Monte Carlo simulations
  - Risk-neutral pricing
  - Stochastic processes (Heston model)
