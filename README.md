# Q-Projects

This repository is for my **risk-neutral quantitative projects**. These techniques are mainly used in the valuation of derivatives and hedging strategies. As I gain experience, I'll continue adding projects in finance and related fields.

## ðŸ“˜ Current Projects

## 1. Option Pricing under stochastic volatility
- Using Monte Carlo simulations to price call options under the Heston model.
- Exploring how changes in heston model parameters affect volatility surfaces.

## 2. Machine Learning Pricing of Barrier Options (Honors Research)
- Simulating Barrier option prices and arbitrage free volatility surfaces from stock path simulations under the Heston model.
- Developing a machine learning framework for pricing barrier options by mapping from an implied volatility surfaces and Barrier level to a Barrier price; (K,T,sigma,B) -> Barrier price.
- Model Validation.

## 3. Solving PDEs using a PINN
- Heat equation
- Call option under Black-Scholes

## ðŸš€ Projects in the Pipeline

## Machine Learning Pricing of Barrier Options using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) (Honors Research Extended)
- Extending the research on barrier options pricing by leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
- Embedding the Heston risk-neutral PDE directly into the neural network architecture to fix some shortcomings of the previous model.
- Model Validation.
