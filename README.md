# Q-Projects

This repository is for my **risk-neutral quantitative projects**, focused on exploring finance under risk-neutral assumptions. These techniques are widely used in the valuation of derivatives, hedging strategies, market risk assessment, and ensuring arbitrage-free pricing in financial models. As I gain experience, I'll continue adding projects in finance and related fields.

## ðŸ“˜ Current Project

### Barrier Option Pricing
- Using Monte Carlo simulations to price barrier options under the Heston model.
- Exploring how changes in model parameters affect option prices.

## ðŸ›  Tools I'm Using
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Techniques**:
  - Monte Carlo simulations
  - Risk-neutral pricing
  - Stochastic processes (Heston model)
