# Q-Projects

This repository is for my **risk-neutral quantitative projects**, focused on exploring finance under risk-neutral assumptions. These techniques are widely used in the valuation of derivatives, hedging strategies, market risk assessment, and ensuring arbitrage-free pricing in financial models. As I gain experience, I'll continue adding projects in finance and related fields.

## ðŸ“˜ Current Project

### Barrier Option Pricing
- Using Monte Carlo simulations to price barrier options under the Heston model.
- Exploring how changes in model parameters affect option prices.

## ðŸš€ Projects in the Pipeline

### 1. Machine Learning Pricing of Barrier Options (Honors Research)
- Developing a machine learning framework for pricing barrier options using stock path simulations generated under the Heston model.
- Investigating the relationship between implied volatility surfaces and barrier option prices.
- Model Validation

### 2. Machine Learning Pricing of Barrier Options using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) (Honors Research Extended)
- Extending the research on barrier options pricing by leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
- Embedding the Heston risk-neutral PDE directly into the neural network architecture for improved accuracy.
- Model Validation


## ðŸ›  Tools I'm Using
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Techniques**:
  - Monte Carlo simulations
  - Risk-neutral pricing
  - Stochastic processes (Heston model)
  - Machine Learning
